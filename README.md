## üöÄ Usage

Once the Registry is up and running, you can interact with it through the API. Here are some common actions you can perform:

### 1. Register a Model Context

To register a new model context, send a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
POST /api/models
```

**Example Request**:

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleModel",
  "description": "This is an example model context.",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Retrieve Model Contexts

To get a list of all registered model contexts, use the following GET request:

```
GET /api/models
```

### 3. Update a Model Context

To update an existing model context, send a PUT request:

```
PUT /api/models/{id}
```

**Example Request**:

```json
{
  "description": "Updated description for the example model."
}
```

### 4. Delete a Model Context

To remove a model context, use the DELETE request:

```
DELETE /api/models/{id}
```
